# First-challenge

## Description

To abide by accessibility guidelines, I altered the HTML file to include semantic elements, then consolidated and organized the CSS file to fall inline with the new HTML for easy and understandable viewing of the code. Through doing so, I furthered my understanding of HTML semantics as well as the preferred organizational structure of CSS.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The site still functions identically to as it did before, and thus can still be used to read up on some of the essentials of online marketing, but through inspecting the page, one can also view the HTML's semantics and the new organization of the CSS file.
